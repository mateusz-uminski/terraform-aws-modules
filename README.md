This repo contains terraform aws modules that I mainly use to provision my test environment
in AWS cloud (see [terragrunt-aws-organization](https://github.com/mateusz-uminski/terragrunt-aws-organization)).
Each module contains its own README file with a brief description. More can be found in commits and code comments.

Feel free to explore and copy everything you want.
Enjoy!
