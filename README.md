This repository serves as a collection of AWS Terraform modules that I use for configuring test environments, learning and verifying unconventional ideas. These modules are mainly used in [terragrunt-aws-organization](https://github.com/mateusz-uminski/terragrunt-aws-organization).

Besides the README.md further documentation can be found in commits, code comments and nested README files.

Feel free to explore and copy everything you want. Enjoy!
